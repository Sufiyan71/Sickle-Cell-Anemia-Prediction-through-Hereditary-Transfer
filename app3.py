# About Our Project
## This project aims to detect Sickle Cell Anemia using deep learning techniques. We have developed a model based on the InceptionV3 architecture, achieving an impressive accuracy of *98.7%*. 

# Hereditary Transfer of Sickle Cell Anemia
 ### Sickle Cell Anemia is a genetic disorder passed from parents to children. If both parents carry the sickle cell trait, there is a:
 ### - 25% chance the child will have Sickle Cell Anemia (SS)
 ### - 50% chance the child will be a carrier (AS)
 ### - 25% chance the child will not carry the trait (AA)

### This hereditary pattern highlights the importance of genetic screening and awareness.
